Shout out to Bob Dahlberg

Mention that I've created lots of case studies. Provide the context.

The situation at the heart of all case studies. You aren't doing X. I believe that you should be doing X.
My goal is to persuade you to start doing it.

Harleen & Aanchal's template

Focus intensely on what's in it for them. Remove yourself and your interests from
the content 100%, other than for transparency reasons.

TODO: get data on developers.google.com/web's most popular case studies. And feedback from WECs.
